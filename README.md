# Blog-With-Database-Final

This is a blog website created with Express. It contains a few standard pages such as the home page (where posts are displayed), an about section, a compose section and 
contact. Posts are stored on a MongoDB database, connected with Mongoose. These posts are then pulled from the database and displayed in either the home screen, or through
their respective URL.
